# kinect
This installation was set up for a dance performance.<br>
The Kinect detects the dancers and projects the visuals on the dancers.
The code is devided in 5 different parts each part has a different visual.
To change between the parts and also to controll some parameters of the visuals we worked with osc messages.
The osc message was sent through a midi controller which was setup with a max patch https://cycling74.com/products/max/. 
To callibrate the kinect camera with the beamer we used this callibration https://github.com/genekogan/KinectProjectorToolkit.
The installation can only run on the old processing version (version 2) because of the libraries that are not compatible with the new version.<br>
There are two main visuals. A good object which a kind of planet system rotating around the dancer.
The other visual is some kind of black net it should remind of some kind of diseases.
